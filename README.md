# Sorting-Visualizer

Hello! 

I have always been incredibly fascinated by sorting algorithms and their functioning, which is why I decided to build this sorting visualizer. This application will help you visualize the code behind the most famous sorting algorithms, hopefully making them easier to grasp. 

This was the first time I build a substantial web application, and previously I had never used React! 

Despite it being a very begginners project, it has being a great source of learning for me. I advanced myself in CSS and JS, and of course, in React. 

I hope this is the first to many projects in the future.
