# Sorting-Visualizer

Hello! 

I have always been incredibly fascinated by sorting algorithms and their functioning, which is why I decided to build this sorting visualizer. This application will help you visualize the code behind the most famous sorting algorithms, hopefully making them easier to grasp.
